<h1>Hi Humans !</h1>
<p>Overall, I am a Futuristic Maker crazy about Technology who dreams of great things and works hard to achieve them.</p>
<p>In more realistic terms, I'm an enthusiastic and persevering future-engineer doing my best to merge my academic training and professional experience to strive for excellence. I am particularly passionate about working on cutting edge Tech by designing smart, autonomous and connected systems.</p>
<p>More precisely, I'm an Electrical Engineering student with a specialization in Automation and Systems Design at the National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT). In parallel, I am pursuing a Research Master in Data Processing in Sound and Vision Perception in co-graduation with Paris Descartes University - France.</p>
<p>As an application of my academic background, I'm currently an Intern in Robotic Systems Integration in Industry of the Future at AIP-PRIMECA cluster within Paul Sabatier University - Toulouse and previously trainee in building open-source autonomous machines for digital manufacturing at OpenLab Hambourg - Germany.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that I'm an active member integrating the Open-source and Fablabs community: I was former Projects Manager at Fablab ENIT an d I participated in the organization of the International Conference of Fablabs FAB14. To sum up, .</p>
<p>For my future, I see myself in a career where I will be able to work on cutting edge technology</p>
